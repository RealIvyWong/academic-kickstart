I am Yingjing Huang (Ivy Wong), a M.S student in Geographic Information Science (GIS) at the [School of Resource and Environmental Sciences](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/) , Wuhan University, supervised by [Dr. Teng Fei](http://faculty.whu.edu.cn/show.jsp?n=Fei%20Teng&lang=cn). I got bachelor's degree from the Department of Geographic Science, [School of Resource and Environmental Sciences](http://sres.whu.edu.cn/) , Wuhan University.

Meanwhile, I write some code out of interest including machine learning, front end, and so on. More info can be found in my [GitHub](https://github.com/RealIvyWong).
